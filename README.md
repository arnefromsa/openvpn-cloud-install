## openvpn-cloud-install
OpenVPN Cloud Install is a fork from the OpenVPN Install script created by [Nyr](https://github.com/Nyr).

The Cloud Install script is executed on the local client machine and will ask a range of questions to provision the resources in a cloud service provider (AWS or Azure), and set up your OpenVPN server.

The script will allow you to set up a VPN Server in the cloud for usage literally in a couple of minutes, with no infrastructure required, just an account with one of the cloud providers.

The initial idea of the project is to get a minimal viable product out that executes correctly, and then adjusting and improving on different aspects of the solution.
